# Not a Keylogger, Trust Me!

This project is an academic spyware which captures keyboard input, saves it to a logfile,
and delivers that log over a network connection. The target environment is Ubuntu 16.04 and older.
The project would also work on newer systems if the user has sudo priveleges. 

# How it works

The user runs the server script on the target machine. The script gains root privileges using Pwnkit and
detects a keyboard device using another shell script. After this initialization, the keylogger actively
captures keyboard events and logs them to file. When the client script is executed, that script connects
to the server by TCP and downloads the log file. 

# How to use

To run the server
	1. cd server
	2. ./run_server.sh

To run the client
	1. cd client
	2. ./run_client.sh
